# force-horse

An angular.js wrapper for a d3.js force fayout

#### USE

force-horse is implemented as an angular.js 1.4 directive. It can be used either as an HTML element or as an HTML element attribute.

&lt;force-horse options=”ctrl.options”&gt;&lt;/force-horse&gt;
or:
&lt;div **force-horse** options=”ctrl.options”&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A force-horse element does not have an intrincsic size. It adapts itself to the size that is set from outside, in the surrounding HTML. force-horse is implementing CSS **flex-box** display logic.
Parameters are passed through the options attribute. Pass an object, which has to  contain the property:
**data**: the graph data (nodes and links)
force-horse writes into the options parameter the property:
**forceHorseInstance**: an object representing one directive instance (note that **several instances**of force-horse may be displayed simultaneously, and independently)
This instance property can be used by the application to register callbacks and/or to call callback apis of the directive. There are four available types of callbacks:
**hover**: a node/link is hovered upon
**select**: a node/link is selected
**dblclick**: a node/link is double-clicked upon
**filter**: remove the selected nodes/links from the graph
In addition, force-horse supports an external json file, **forceHorse.json**. In this file one can set whether each of the buttons (see below) is displayed or not. Also, force layout parameters can be set, and thus to override the parameters that force-horse computes automatically, for a specific implementation.

The forceHorse project contains a complete **demo application**. The demo application is also available on the [plunker](http://embed.plnkr.co/SYmehtaAnQVyMpLJJY2B/?show=preview) site.

#### VISUAL INTERFACE

On activation, force-horse show the given graph. The graph stabilizes after a short force simulation. Then, if needed, it **zooms **out, so that the whole graph can be seen at a glance.
Beside showing the graph itself, force-horse provides visual indication of **hovering **over a node/link, and of **selecting **a node/link. It supports node **dragging**, and also **pan **and **zoom**.
In addition, force-horse is providing the following buttons:
**filter**: remove selected nodes/links from the graph
**pause/play**: allows to “freeze” the graph, to locate nodes without subsequent changes by the force-layout simulation
**home**: automatically pan/zoom so that the whole graph can be seen at a glance
**labels**: show/hide node labels
**node weight**: show/hide node weight (weightier nodes will be larger)
**link weight**: show/hide link weight (weightier links will be thicker)

#### DEPENDENCIES

The main dependencies of force-horse are:
**angular.js** v1.4
**d3.js** v3
A complete list can be found in file **bower.json** at the project’s root.

#### PERFORMANCE

force-horse was designed for high performance. Some of the measures in use are:
-minimal use of angular **$watch**’es
-large graphs are not rendered continuously, but only a few times during the force simulation. The screen rendering is controlled programmatically, implementing javascript**requestAnimationFrame**(). A thin **progress bar** is displayed, during a force simulation, so that even if rendering is held, the user can know the stage and the pace of the current force simulation.

#### MULTIPLE LINKS BETWEEN TWO NODES

The ability to compute multiple, parallel link between two nodes is not currently supported intrinsically by d3.js. It was also not yet developed by the users community. Therefore, we developed this ability especially for force-horse. For the mathematical and implementation details, see [here](http://webiks.com/d3-js-force-layout-straight-parallel-links/).
